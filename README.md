Make sure the api server is running [api server](https://github.com/minirenatinho/afazer-api)

## Installing dependencies

```sh

```

## Development server

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
